# BrowserRelief
An extension gives your Chrome relief. It helps you record the URLs of tabs opened in the current single window before you kill the window and reload them when browser restarted.

### Remote Recording
BrowserRelief records the URLs and uploads it to the cloud provided by Google if you log in to the chrome browser and have connection to Internet and Google (and it also works in incognito). **You can reload it on another computer afterwards.**
